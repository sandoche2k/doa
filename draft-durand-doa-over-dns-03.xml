     <t>
       This document defines a DOA RR type to implement the Digital Object
       Architecture over DNS.
     </t>
   </abstract>
</front>

<middle>
   <section title="Introduction">
     <t> This document defines an RR type to implement an architecture similar
   to the Digital Object Architecture <xref target='ITU-X.1255'/> within the DNS.  Each
   DOA RR contains an object type that might be opaque and private to
   the producer and the consumer of the data and either the data (if
   small enough to fit in the RR) or a pointer on how to retrieve the
   actual data. </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Terminology">
     <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 <xref target='RFC2119'/> <xref target='RFC8174'/> when, and only when,
   they appear in all capitals, as shown here. </t>
   </section>

   <section title="The DOA Resource Record">
     <section title="Description">
       <t> The Type value for the DOA RR is TBD.  The DOA RR is class
   independent.  No special processing is required within DNS servers or
   libraries. </t>

   <t> The RDATA of the resource record comprises of five fields: DOA-
   ENTERPRISE, DOA-TYPE, DOA-MEDIA-TYPE, DOA-LOCATION and DOA-DATA.</t>

            <section title="Enterprise and Type fields">
          <t> The DOA-ENTERPRISE and DOA-TYPE fields are combined to indicate the
   semantic type of the DOA record being represented by the RR.  That
   semantic is private to the producer of data hosted on an
   authoritative DNS server and the application software using a DNS
   stub resolver to retrieve it.</t>
          <t> The DOA-ENTERPRISE field uses values as specified in the IANA SMI
   Network Management Private Enterprise Codes Registry
   <xref target='IANA-ENTERPRISE'/>.  An exception to that is that the reserved value
   of zero (0) is used to indicate that the the DOA-ENTERPRISE is not
   set. </t>

          <t> Some commonly used values of DOA-TYPE are registered in the IANA DOA
   Type Registry Section 7.1, others are privately defined.  As those
   private types might be used in cross-organization systems, use of the
   DOA-ENTERPRISE field is RECOMMENDED to disambiguate types. </t>
            </section>

        <section title="Location field">
          <t> The DOA-LOCATION signals how the DOA-DATA field should be interpreted
   using the values specified in the DOA Location Type Registry
   Section 7.2.</t>

          <t> The value 0 is reserved.</t>

          <t> For the value 1 ("Local"), the DOA-DATA contains the actual DOA
   object. </t>

          <t> For the value 2 ("URI") the DOA-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the URI from which the DOA object can be obtained. </t>

          <t> For the value 3 ("HDL") the DOA-DATA contains a UTF-8 encoded string
   representing the handle from the Handle System  <xref target='RFC3650'/>  from which
   the DOA object can be obtained. </t>

          <t> Other values might be defined in the future, for example for NFS,
   LDAP, etc... </t>

          <t> DNS software implementing the DOA RR type MUST NOT drop or otherwise
   refuse to handle the DOA RRs containing an unknown or unsupported
   DOA-location and MUST treat the DOA-DATA portion of the RR as an
   abstract opaque field. </t>
        </section>

          <section title="Media Type">
            <t> The DOA-MEDIA-TYPE field contains the Internet media type <xref
              target='RFC6838'/> for the DOA object represented by this record. </t>

            <t> If a non-Local object is retrieved over a protocol that supports
   inclusion of a media type value (e.g. an HTTP Content-Type header)
   then the client MUST use that value (if supplied) in preference to
   any value specified inside this resource record.  In such case, the
   DOA-MEDIA-TYPE MAY be set to NULL, length 0. </t>
          </section>

          <section title="Data">
            <t> The DOA-DATA field contains either the object's data, or some form of
   reference specifying from where the data can be obtained, per the
   DOA-LOCATION field above. </t>
          </section>
        </section>

          been taken into account. </t>

        <t> The DOA-DATA is presented as Base64 encoded data <xref target='RFC4648'/>

          character ("-", ASCII 45).  White space is permitted within Base64
          data. </t>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t> The use of DNSSEC is encouraged to protect the integrity of the data
   contained in the DOA RR type. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Privacy  Considerations">
    <t> Personally identifiable information (PII) data appearing in the DOA-
  DATA field SHOULD be encrypted. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Operational Considerations">
    <t>   Some DOA records might contain large data that is only of interest to
       a single party, as such, caching those records does not provide much
       benefits and could be considered a denial of service attack on the
       caching resolver infrastructure.  It is thus RECOMMENDED that the TTL
       associated with large DOA RRs be set as small as possible to avoid
       caching. </t>
